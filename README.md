# Star-Wars-Space-Invaders
This is a modified version of space invaders, using the Millenium Falcon for the ship, and Thai Fighters for the aliens. It usses star wars effects for blasters and ship collision, and it also uses a Chewbaca sound effects for "Alien" to "Ship" collision. This was made using the pygame module.
